"""dsp_close_on_20low_not_a_cascade_then_up -- leftover-3 ALL36, 2026-08-21.

This bar makes the 20-low and closes in its bottom quarter, but the path to the
low was a 1-4 bar sell from a nearby high, not an 8-20 bar cascade. Stops under
the low are resting; the next expansion is the squeeze the other way. NZDCAD 5
sells 0.94997 to 0.94753 in two bars and rips. ETC 18 tags 12.458 then 12.296
on 4.27x and rips (BTC already +5.54). XAGAUD 33 closes ON 32.744 and rips
10.96 (gold already +7.46). The cascade cousins 6/11/26 have the same
close-on-low and go THROUGH down — they already spent the morning making lower
highs, and the 12-bar high is 6-11 ATR away.

MEASURED (never assumed):
  displacement within 3 bars, base rate 1.252%
  V2 split: lift 1.58x disc / 1.61x hold  n_fire 339,391  n_disp 6,834
  V2 up-rate 40.5% labelled SHORT (WRONG)
  geometry.py first-touch 1.0/6.0 LONG  hold R +0.163  (n_hold 356,396)
  (0.75/6.0 is best_both_halves +0.207; ship 1.0/6.0 to stay out of the FX 5-8 pip bleed)
  scored over 166 instruments; formula evaluated bar-by-bar, causal, index <= i.

Proposed by swarm shard 26 (verified_w5.json). ALL36 leftover #1.
What would kill it: After a bar that makes the 20-low, closes in its bottom
30%, and is not coming from a 6+ ATR / 6-down-bar cascade, a >=4 ATR UP bar
within 3 bars is no more common than a second flush (21 TTE tags 51.41 and
goes; 6 ETH tags 146.62 and crashes), or 5 and 18 remaining stop-runs (MAE
7.85 and 10.81) are the whole edge.

Status forward_only: this has a split-sample backtest and NO forward record.
Confidence starts at 0.15 for that reason. NOT ARMED.
